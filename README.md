# Welcome to the Mkulima Decision Support System
Officially known as the "Decision Support system for farming recommendations",\
 this project aims to assist farmers in deciding what to plant accross various\
 parts of Kenya.

This project has been done as part of the assesment for SIT 306: Decision\
 Support Systems in Murang'a University of Technology's BSc. IT class of\
 2025.

## How it works
The user inputs their county, and the system recommends the top three choices\
 for that country, taking in various factors such as climate, rainfall(mm/pa),\
 and soil type(implementation not complete).

### How to run the system locally
- Git clone this project into XAMPP (or WAMPP) using the following command:
- (git clone https://github.com/josphat-kahihia/The-Mkulima-DSS)
- Open the index.html (or homepage.html) file, and use the web interface to\
 proceed.

### Sections needing more work (Recommendations)
Should our work be built upon, we recommend the following:
1. Introduction of ML and AI sub-systems to improve crop recommendation
2. Introduction of data crawlers to source more types of crops and their\
 requirements, as well as individual land characteristics on smaller scales\
 eg: villages.
3. Improved user data protection measures such as using quantum proof security\
 methods.
